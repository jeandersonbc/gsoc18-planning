# Google Summer of Code 2018

* [Proposal Approved :white_check_mark:](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4588925163667456)
* Feel free to **leave a star** and **fork** this repository if you find it useful :smile:

## About

This is my personal planning to the GSOC'18 edition.

Feel free to use this repository to learn when and how I approached the mentoring organization to increase my chances.
Different organizations have different criteria for acceptance, so I can't guarantee that you will succeed if you
strictly follow my steps; however, I do guarantee you that you will be in **advantage** compared to other students.

An interesting thing to do is to review my commit history, and compare to the GSOC'18 schedule.

## This Repository

The main content here is related to my proposal.
To compile the `.tex` files, you will need a TeX/LaTeX engine and `make` to use the `Makefile`.
Run `make` in the current directory to produce the final output.
There are some other secondary files for notes and analysis.
