For communication and development, we suggest the following practice:

1. Create an issue on the issue tracker for each task (except minor work
taking less than one hour). Use a descriptive title, and write a short
summary; one sentence is often enough, but don't just rephrase the title.

2. In commit messages, refer to the issue tracker item. Examples:

Add new subclass for X (#42).

Implement feature Y (closes #42).

Fix bug Z (fixes #42).

github recognizes "#<number>" and will automatically link from the commit
message to the issue, making code reviews and navigation much easier.

github will also automatically close issues related to accepted pull
requests, if the message has a text like "closes #x", "fixes #x".

3. Keep us updated with a short e-mail about tasks achieved, and especially
plans for tasks ahead and problems/difficulties where you need advice.
If you have an issue but you're not sure how to resolve it, use the comment
function in the issue tracker, and send us the link in the e-mail.

4. We will try to have regular Skype meetings, as far as possible given the
disparate time zones. However, communication in the issue tracker is best,
as it's easier to navigate and search than e-mails or Skype chat.
